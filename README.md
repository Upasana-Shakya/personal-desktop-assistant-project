# personal-desktop-assistant-project
This Python project implements a voice-controlled virtual assistant named Jarvis. This
assistant is capable of performing various tasks based on user voice commands. The 
functionalities include greetings based on the time of day, checking internet 
connectivity, retrieving information from Wikipedia, opening specific websites, 
playing music, providing the current time and date, launching a code editor, and 
handling simple calculations.

This project utilizes the pyttsx3 library for text-to-speech, the SpeechRecognition 
library for voice recognition, and other standard libraries for date and time handling, 
web browsing, and system operations. This assistant continuously listens for user input, 
processes the queries using a set of predefined rules, and responds accordingly.

Now the basic question arises in mind that how it is an AI? The virtual assistant that I 
have created is like if it is not an A.I, but it is the output of a bundle of the 
statement. But fundamentally, the main purpose of A.I. machines is that it can perform 
human tasks with the same efficiency or even more efficiently than humans. It is a fact 
that my virtual assistant is not a very good example of A.I., but it is an A.I
